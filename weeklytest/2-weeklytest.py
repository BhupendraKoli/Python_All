Q1. Explain the difference between for loop and while loop in python. Provide an example of each

    for loop: Used when you want to iterate over a sequence (like a list, string, or range) a specific number of times.

    for i in range(5):
    print(i)
    Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

    while loop: Used when you want to repeat an action as long as a condition is true.

     i = 0
    while i < 5:
       print(i)
       i += 1
       Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4


Q2. Discuss the role of the range() function in a for loop.
    
    The range() function generates a sequence of numbers.
    It's commonly used with for loops to repeat a block of code a specific number of times.
    for i in range(3):  # i will be 0, 1, 2
       print("Hello")
        Output: Hello, Hello, Hello


Q3. What is an infinite loop? Provide an example and explain how to break out of it.
     An infinite loop keeps running forever because the condition never becomes false.
    You can use the break statement to exit it manually.

      Example:

      while True:
         name = input("Type 'exit' to quit: ")
         if name == "exit":
          break

Q4. What is a set? How is it different from a list?
      A set is an unordered collection of unique elements.
      A list is an ordered collection and can contain duplicates.
      Example:
        my_set = {1, 2, 3, 3}
        print(my_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3}

        my_list = [1, 2, 3, 3]
        print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 3]

Q5. What is an Interpreted Language?
     An interpreted language executes code line-by-line using an interpreter.
     Python is an interpreted language, which makes it easier for debugging but may run slower than compiled languages.


Q6. Difference between if, elif, and else statement. Provide an example.
    if: Tests the first condition.
    elif: Tests other conditions if the previous ones are false.
    else: Executes if all if and elif conditions are false.

 Example:
    x = 10
    if x < 0:
        print("Negative")
    elif x == 0:
        print("Zero")
    else:
        print("Positive")

Q7. Discuss the difference between and, or, not logical operators in Python.
     and: Returns True if both conditions are True.
     or: Returns True if at least one condition is True.
     not: Reverses the result (True becomes False, and vice versa).
        
Q8. How can you convert a string to an integer? Example s = "6"
     Use the int() function:

     s = "6"
     num = int(s)
     print(num + 4)  # Output: 10


Q9 What is the difference between lists, tuples, and sets?    
    1. Lists
         Ordered: Yes  items maintain the order you add them.
         Mutable: Yes  you can add, remove, or change elements.
         Allows Duplicates: Yes  the same value can appear multiple times.
         Indexable: Yes access items by position using [index].
         Syntax: Square brackets [].

    2. Tuples
         Ordered: Yes
         Immutable: Yes â€“ once created, cannot change values.
         Allows Duplicates: Yes
         Indexable: Yes
         Syntax: Parentheses ().
    
    3. Sets
         Ordered: No items do not maintain insertion order.
         Mutable: Yes you can add or remove items.
         Allows Duplicates: No  only unique values are allowed.
         Indexable: No  cannot access items using an index.
         Syntax: Curly braces {}.     
         

Q10. Explain the concept of Nested if statement. Provide an example.
      A nested if means an if statement inside another if block.

      Example:
      x = 10
      if x > 5:
          if x < 20:
              print("x is between 5 and 20")
